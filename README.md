Array based problem

You are given an array consisting of n positive intigers. Your task is to determine whether the 
array is sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is greater than or equal to the 
previous one)). Print "YES" is the array is sorted, otherwise print "NO".

Example: 
input n = 5; {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: YES

Input: n = 4; {10,5,7,8}
Output: NO
